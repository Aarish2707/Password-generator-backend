# Password-generator-backend

## 1. Project Name

Password-generator-backend

## 2. Tech Stack

This project utilizes the following technologies:

* **Primary Language:** Java
* **Build Tool:** Maven
* **Markup Language:** HTML (likely used for any potential frontend integration, though minimal in this instance based on file size)


## 3. Modules and Packages

While a detailed package structure will be outlined in the file structure section below, the core functionality of this backend project revolves around generating secure passwords.  This likely involves modules responsible for:

* **Password Generation:**  A core module handling the cryptographic aspects of password creation, including length, character sets (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols), and entropy considerations.  This module will likely contain classes responsible for random number generation, character selection, and string manipulation to construct the passwords.

* **Security Handling:**  A separate module or class focusing on secure storage and handling of any sensitive data, such as configuration parameters or temporary password storage (though ideally, passwords should never be stored in plain text). This might involve techniques like hashing and salting, if applicable.

* **API Endpoints (potential):** Based on the presence of HTML, there might be rudimentary API endpoints (likely RESTful) to expose the password generation functionality to a frontend application. This would involve using a framework such as Spring Boot (though this is not explicitly stated).


## 4. Environment Variables

This project may utilize environment variables, depending on its specific configuration. For example, if database connection details or API keys are used for external services, these would be stored as environment variables.  Due to the limited information available, specific variables are not listed.  However, if this project were to include external dependencies, the instructions to set the necessary environment variables would be included here.  Typically this would involve setting variables in the `.env` file (if used) or within the operating system's environment settings.


## 5. Setup Instructions

To set up and run this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone the project from its GitHub repository using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd Password-generator-backend
   ```

3. **Build the Project:** Use Maven to build the project.  Ensure you have Maven installed and configured correctly on your system.

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

4. **Run the Application:** The specific command to run the application will depend on how the application is packaged (e.g., JAR file, WAR file). The `pom.xml` file will provide hints regarding packaging and the execution command.  A typical example (if packaged as a JAR) might look like this:

   ```bash
   java -jar target/<application_name>.jar
   ```

   Replace `<application_name>.jar` with the actual name of the generated JAR file found in the `target` directory.


## 6. Repository File Structure

The project's file structure is as follows:


```
Password-generator-backend/
├── .gitattributes
├── .gitignore
├── .mvn/
│   └── ...
├── README.md
├── mvnw
├── mvnw.cmd
├── pom.xml
└── src/
    └── ... (Source code files, organized into packages)
```

The `src` directory contains the Java source code, organized into packages reflecting the application's modular design. Further subdirectories within `src` will depend on the project's internal structure (e.g., `src/main/java`, `src/test/java`, etc.).
